# Personal Project - Beetle Blast
## Player Controls
### Current Working Features:
- Player can move left and right with the arrow keys
- Player is constrained to bounds
- Player's velocity resets when it reaches bounds
- Enemies and health can move up the screen at different speeds
- Player can shoot/spray by pressing the spacebar
### Features to Add:
- Enemies and health spawn randomly
- Speed of bugs increases over time
- Number of beetles increase over time
- Health has a constant rotation (animation mimic)
- Destroy objects when they collide
- Dying animations when objects collide
- Health animation
- UI stuff 
### Features to Change:
- Player controls switch to mouse click instead of arrow keys
- Spray bottle moves with mouse, shoots projectile in the direction of the click (or we could just have a spray animation with the bottle, and an animation on the insect implying that it has been sprayed)
- Insects come from all directions instead of just moving bottom to top
- Edit trigger controls on objects
